1. ----------------------------------------Advanced Node.js Concepts---------------------------------------

Implement an event-driven architecture using Node.js's EventEmitter to handle asynchronous operations

- Use streams to efficiently process and manipulate large amounts of data in Node.js

- Implement worker threads to perform parallel processing tasks in a Node.js application

- Design and develop a microservice architecture with Node.js services communicating through message queues

- Optimize the performance of a Node.js application by identifying and resolving bottlenecks

- Implement advanced security mechanisms such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication in a Node.js application

- Build a distributed system using Node.js that communicates through message queues

- Containerize a Node.js application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform

- Able to write unit test cases

- Able to write the integration test cases

2. ----------------------------------------Advanced Database Integration------------------------------------

- Perform advanced database queries in Node.js, including joins and subqueries

- Implement database transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency

- Optimize database queries by creating indexes and using query optimization techniques

- Use database migration tools to manage database schema changes in a Node.js application

- Perform database operations using an ORM library like Knex or Sequelize or TypeORM

3. -----------------------------------Advanced Authentication and Authorization----------------------------------

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) in a Node.js application using a library or service

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with different user roles and permissions

- Integrate single sign-on (SSO) functionality using popular identity providers (e.g., OAuth, SAML)

- Implement fine-grained authorization and access control based on user roles and permissions

- Follow security best practices for handling user credentials, including secure storage and encryption

4. ----------------------------------Advanced Error Handling and Logging----------------------------------------

- Implement centralized error handling and logging in a Node.js application to capture and log errors

- Handle errors in asynchronous operations and propagate them correctly throughout the application

- Set up error monitoring and alerting to receive notifications for critical errors

- Configure different logging levels and implement log rotation for managing log files

- Integrate with a third-party logging service and send application logs to it for analysis and monitoring

5. ------------------------------Advanced Performance Monitoring and Optimization-------------------------------

- Use profiling and benchmarking tools to analyze the performance of a Node.js application and identify bottlenecks

- Optimize memory management and garbage collection in a Node.js application to improve performance

- Implement caching mechanisms using Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data

- Perform load testing on a Node.js application and apply performance tuning techniques

- Design and implement scaling and load balancing strategies for a Node.js application to handle high traffic

6. -------------------------------------Advanced Security and Compliance----------------------------------------------

- Implement secure handling of sensitive data, including encryption and data masking techniques

- Perform security testing and vulnerability scanning on a Node.js application to identify and address security vulnerabilities

- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) when handling user data

- Configure and enable secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL) for a Node.js application

- Set up security monitoring and incident response mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents in a Node.js application

7. ---------------------------------Integration of cloud services ------------------------------------------------------

- Implement the apis for upload, get and delete the document on cloud platform eg. AWS or GCP

- Should have the knowledge of AWS services like lambda, EC2, SQS, S3 buckets.

- Develop and deploy applications with the AWS SDK for JavaScript.
